# React Native & Flutter Assessment

**Time:** ~30 minutes total per stack (React Native: ~15–20, Flutter: ~15–20)  
**Rules:** Coding-only. No internet. Keep answers inside the `// TODO` blocks.

## What to complete
- React Native: `react-native/tasks.tsx`
- Flutter: `flutter/tasks.dart`

Both files include small mock APIs and stubs. You only need to implement the TODOs.
